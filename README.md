# Recipe Generator
A generative AI tool designed to seamlessly generate recipes, determine the difficulty level of the recipe, and find famous places associated with the dish.

## Steps to run Streamlit app:
1. To create a new OpenAI API key or use an existing one, visit: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys.

2. In the `credentials.py` file, replace the existing credentials with your own.
3. Create a new environment: <br>```conda create -p genai python==3.9 -y```
4. Activate the environment: <br>```conda activate genai```
5. Install the requirements: <br>```pip install -r requirements.txt```
6. Run the Streamlit application: <br>```streamlit run main.py```

## About Techniques:
Langchain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are context-aware and reason.
1. Importing LLMs - We can develop the application by using Large Language models easily with the help of langchain. The LLM class is designed to provide a standard interface for many LLM providers.
   <br>```from langchain.llms import OpenAI```
2. Prompt Template - A template of a prompt can be easily designed with the help of the PromptTemplate class.
   <br>```from langchain import PromptTemplate```
3. LLM chain - The LLMChain class is used to execute the PromptTemplate.
   <br>```from langchain.chains import LLMChain```
4. Sequential Chain - When we have multiple prompts, where each prompt depends on the previous prompt's output, we can run them sequentially using the SequentialChain class.
   <br>```from langchain.chains import SequentialChain```
5. Memory - We can save the outputs generated by the LLM into buffer memory or any databases with the help of the Memory class in langchain.
   <br>```from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory```
